# TestmeQA Job Engine

An hourly bot that finds jobs, cleans them up, sorts them into categories, and posts them to your WordPress site automatically.

## What it does, every hour

1. **Fetches** jobs from 5 sources:
   - Remotive, RemoteOK, Arbeitnow — remote job APIs
   - We Work Remotely — RSS (programming + QA categories)
   - HotNigerianJobs, MyJobMag — RSS (Nigeria-focused)
2. **Removes duplicates** — both within the same run (two sites listing the same job) and against everything it's already posted before.
3. **Categorizes** each job by work mode (Remote / Hybrid / Onsite), country (Nigeria, UK, USA, etc.), seniority (Junior, Mid-level, Senior, Internship), and discipline (QA / Testing, Frontend, Backend, DevOps, etc.).
4. **Publishes** each new job as a WordPress post, tagged with those categories, in one shot.
5. **Remembers** what it's already posted, so it never duplicates a listing.

## One-time setup

### 1. Get a WordPress Application Password

This is WordPress's official way to let a script log in and create posts on your behalf, without using your real login password.

1. Log into your WordPress admin (`yoursite.com/wp-admin`).
2. Go to **Users → Profile** (or **Users → All Users → [your user]**).
3. Scroll to **Application Passwords**.
4. Type a name for it, e.g. `job-engine`, click **Add New Application Password**.
5. Copy the password shown (looks like `abcd 1234 efgh 5678`) — you won't see it again.

You now have three values: your site URL, your WordPress username, and this application password.

> If you don't see an "Application Passwords" section, your host may have it disabled, or you're on an older WordPress version (< 5.6). Either update WordPress, or install the free **Application Passwords** plugin, or use a plugin like **WP REST API - OAuth1** instead (ask me and I'll adjust the code).

### 2. Put this code on GitHub

- Create a new (private is fine) GitHub repo, e.g. `testmeqa-job-engine`.
- Push everything in this folder to it.

### 3. Add your WordPress credentials as GitHub Secrets

In your repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**. Add:

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `WP_URL` | `https://yoursite.com` (no trailing slash) |
| `WP_USER` | your WordPress username |
| `WP_APP_PASSWORD` | the application password from step 1 |

### 4. That's it

The workflow in `.github/workflows/job-engine.yml` runs automatically every hour. You can also trigger it manually any time from the **Actions** tab in GitHub → **Job Engine** → **Run workflow**.

## Testing locally before you push

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your real WP_URL / WP_USER / WP_APP_PASSWORD
DRY_RUN=1 npm start    # fetches + categorizes but does NOT post to WordPress
npm start               # the real thing — will actually publish posts
```

## Tuning it

- **Add/remove job sources**: edit `src/sources/` (each file exports one `fetchX()` function returning normalized jobs) and register it in `SOURCES` in `src/index.js`.
- **Add/remove categories or keywords**: edit `src/lib/categorize.js` — it's plain keyword lists, easy to extend (e.g. add more Nigerian cities, more seniority synonyms, more tech disciplines).
- **Change the schedule**: edit the `cron` line in `.github/workflows/job-engine.yml` (currently `0 * * * *` = top of every hour, UTC).
- **How long duplicates are remembered**: `pruneStore()` in `src/index.js` currently keeps 90 days of history in `data/jobs-seen.json` — adjust the number if you want it shorter/longer.

## How de-duplication survives across hourly runs

Every job gets a stable ID (a hash of title + company + URL). After a job is published, its ID is saved to `data/jobs-seen.json`. GitHub Actions commits that file back to the repo after every run, so the "memory" persists between hourly runs — it's not lost when the workflow container shuts down.

## Notes on the sources

- The APIs (Remotive, RemoteOK, Arbeitnow) are free and don't need a key.
- The RSS feeds (We Work Remotely, HotNigerianJobs, MyJobMag) are the sites' own public syndication feeds. If a site changes its feed URL or blocks automated requests, that one source will just log an error and skip — it won't break the other sources or crash the run.
- Want more Nigerian-specific sources? Jobberman and some others don't publish a public API/RSS, so pulling from them would mean scraping their HTML, which is a different (and more fragile / ToS-sensitive) approach. Happy to add that if you want it, just say so.
